> A simple quizzes app.

## Quick Start

## Usage

**Enquete** is the simple way to make small researches when the user can create and opinate whatever subject they 
want. The results and changes are showed in real time
It is possible to search and check the result for the quizzes, but for those resources is needed to create an account
and sign in.
The app uses the firebase platform and are writing using AngularJs.
Currently the app are deployed at this  [test server](https://enquete-ba752.firebaseapp.com/) is maintained by me.
