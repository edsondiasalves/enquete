# Enquete

> A simple quizzes app.

## Quick Start

## Usage

**Enquete** is the simple way to make small researches, the user can create and opinate whatever subject they 
want. The quizzes, results and changes are showed in real time
It is possible to search and check the result for all quizzes, but for create or opinate is needed to create an
 account and sign in.
The app uses the firebase platform and we are using AngularJs in the frontend.
Currently the app is deployed at this [test server](https://enquete-ba752.firebaseapp.com/) is maintained by me.
Feel free to fork it and collaborate..
